# Objectives

- Become familiar with inputting and outputting data in Python
- Evaluate simple expressions

---

## Scenario

Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.

```python
# input a float value for variable a here
# input a float value for variable b here

# output the result of addition here
# output the result of subtraction here
# output the result of multiplication here
# output the result of division here

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
```

The results have to be printed to the console.

You may not be able to protect the code from a user who wants to divide by zero. That's okay, don't worry about it for now.

Test your code – does it produce the results you expect?

We won't show you any test data – that would

# Objectives 2

- Become familiar with the concept of numbers, operators, and arithmetic operations in Python.
- Understand the precedence and associativity of Python operators, as well as the proper use of parentheses.

## Scenario 2

Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:

![Continued Fraction](./input_project/equation.PNG)

The result should be assigned to `y`. Be careful—watch the operators and keep their priorities in mind. Don't hesitate to use as many parentheses as you need.

You can use additional variables to shorten the expression (but it's not necessary). Test your code carefully.
