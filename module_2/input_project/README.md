# Objectives

- Become familiar with inputting and outputting data in Python
- Evaluate simple expressions

---

# Scenario

Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.

```python
# input a float value for variable a here
# input a float value for variable b here

# output the result of addition here
# output the result of subtraction here
# output the result of multiplication here
# output the result of division here

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
```

The results have to be printed to the console.

You may not be able to protect the code from a user who wants to divide by zero. That's okay, don't worry about it for now.

Test your code – does it produce the results you expect?

We won't show you any test data – that would
